# Horizon A Milestone Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up the "Horizon A: Geometry Hardening" milestone in GitHub.

---

## Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

If you have the GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated:

```bash
# Create the milestone
./scripts/create-horizon-a-milestone.sh

# Create all 19 issues (optional - can also create manually)
./scripts/create-horizon-a-issues.sh
```

---

## Option 2: Using GitHub Web UI (Manual)

### Step 1: Create the Milestone

1. Navigate to: `https://github.com/madfam-io/brepflow/milestones`

2. Click **"New milestone"** button

3. Fill in the form:

   **Title**:
   ```
   Horizon A: Geometry Hardening
   ```

   **Due date**:
   ```
   March 31, 2026
   ```

   **Description**:
   ```markdown
   Complete OCCT pipeline optimization and geometry reliability improvements.

   Building on completed Horizon 0 (Security & Quality Hardening), this milestone focuses on:

   1. **OCCT Performance & Recovery**: Performance profiling, operation diagnostics, error recovery, memory optimization
   2. **CLI & Studio Alignment**: Unified GeometryAPI, remove mock fallbacks, structured error propagation
   3. **Mock Geometry Teardown**: Complete removal of MockGeometry, OCCT-only execution, test fixtures
   4. **Autogenerated Node Catalogue**: Fix generator, compile 1012+ nodes, validation framework, palette integration
   5. **Type Safety & Artifact Hygiene**: Strict TypeScript, lint enforcement, artifact cleanup, OCCT docs

   **Timeline**: 12 weeks (Q1 2026)
   **Target Completion**: March 31, 2026
   **Total Issues**: 19 across 5 workstreams

   See `docs/project/HORIZON_A_GEOMETRY_HARDENING.md` for detailed roadmap and `docs/project/HORIZON_A_GITHUB_ISSUES.md` for issue templates.
   ```

4. Click **"Create milestone"**

---

### Step 2: Create the Issues

Use the templates from `docs/project/HORIZON_A_GITHUB_ISSUES.md` to create each of the 19 issues.

#### Quick Create Process:

1. Navigate to: `https://github.com/madfam-io/brepflow/issues/new`

2. For each issue:
   - Copy the **Title** from the template
   - Copy the **Body** from the template
   - Add the **Labels** listed in the template
   - Select **Milestone**: "Horizon A: Geometry Hardening"
   - Click **"Submit new issue"**

3. Repeat for all 19 issues

---

### Step 3: Set Up Labels (If Not Already Created)

Create these labels in your repository if they don't exist:

**Workstream Labels**:
- `horizon-a` (color: #0E8A16) - All Horizon A work
- `occt` (color: #1D76DB) - OCCT geometry work
- `performance` (color: #D93F0B) - Performance optimization
- `monitoring` (color: #FBCA04) - Diagnostics and monitoring
- `error-handling` (color: #D93F0B) - Error handling
- `memory` (color: #D93F0B) - Memory management
- `api` (color: #0052CC) - API design
- `refactor` (color: #0052CC) - Code refactoring
- `cleanup` (color: #C5DEF5) - Code cleanup
- `testing` (color: #BFD4F2) - Testing improvements
- `ci` (color: #5319E7) - CI/CD work
- `generator` (color: #1D76DB) - Node generator
- `typescript` (color: #1D76DB) - TypeScript
- `quality` (color: #0E8A16) - Code quality
- `documentation` (color: #0075CA) - Documentation
- `studio` (color: #E99695) - Studio app
- `ui` (color: #E99695) - UI work

**Timeline Labels**:
- `week-1-2` (color: #C2E0C6)
- `week-3-4` (color: #C2E0C6)
- `week-5-6` (color: #C2E0C6)
- `week-7-8` (color: #C2E0C6)

To create labels:
1. Go to: `https://github.com/madfam-io/brepflow/labels`
2. Click **"New label"**
3. Enter name and color
4. Click **"Create label"**

## Option 3: Using GitHub API (Advanced)

If you prefer to use the GitHub REST API:

```bash
# Set your GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"

# Create milestone
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/madfam-io/brepflow/milestones \
  -d '{
    "title": "Horizon A: Geometry Hardening",
    "state": "open",
    "description": "Complete OCCT pipeline optimization and geometry reliability improvements. See docs/project/HORIZON_A_GEOMETRY_HARDENING.md",
    "due_on": "2026-03-31T23:59:59Z"
  }'

# Create issue (example for first issue)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/madfam-io/brepflow/issues \
  -d '{
    "title": "[Horizon A] OCCT Performance Profiling & Baseline",
    "body": "...",
    "labels": ["horizon-a", "performance", "occt", "week-1-2"],
    "milestone": 1
  }'
```
